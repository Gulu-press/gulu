# About 2020 #

## Go through last yearâ€™s calendar week by week. If you see an important event, family gathering, friendly get-together or a significant project, write it down here. ##

Not really a year of gathering or get-together. Actually, this year I spent most of my time in my cramped  appartment, regretting regularly I should have rented a spacious one. I traveled to Madrid, Munich, Mallorca and Sevilla, and the one to Mallorca was with my teammates.

Talking about the biggest event, it should be the outburst of COVID 19 - I suffered a lot between January and March, then I got used to living with it and also with its side effects on job hunting, interaction with people and travel.

Most of the big events of the year were related to the job hunting - every interview with a consulting firm entailed several hours of preps. And every "no" increased my anxiety to different degrees.

A significant project was a simulation, in which I spent extra hours to build a solid model, but at the end, I realized the key takeaway from this simulation wasn' t a model but understanding more about different stakeholders in a business.

## This is what my last year was about ##
### personal life and family ###
